<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Ananya, a second-year B.Tech student specializing in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). With a strong foundation in programming languages like C and C++, as well as web development skills in HTML and CSS, I’m passionate about solving problems and creating impactful software solutions. Currently, I’m delving deeper into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through a dedicated series on YouTube, and I’m also exploring the world of web development by learning JavaScript and advanced concepts through an Udemy course by Angela Yu. I’m motivated to grow as a software developer and continually refine my technical skills.</p>

<p>In addition to my technical pursuits, I aspire to broaden my horizons by pursuing an MBA from one of the world’s top universities after completing my undergraduate degree. This ambition stems from my desire to blend technical expertise with business acumen, allowing me to excel in leadership roles and drive innovation. With a focused mindset and a passion for learning, I’m working toward building a future where I can make meaningful contributions to the tech industry while growing as a professional and an individual.
